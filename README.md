# Build a basic 3D raytracer

**Learning link**: https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work.html

This is a demo lesson more or less. So the code isn't too beginner-friendly. 

Ultimately, I read through the lesson and didn't clone the demo code.

But there are more lessons, so hopefully, we can build stuff from the ground up.
